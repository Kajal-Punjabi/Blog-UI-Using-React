We all want energy to do work, we all want to become successful in our lives, 
we all want to achieve our life goals with positivity. But are we all really 
working on them ? To do work energetically, we all need to get motivated first. 
Most of the time we get demotivated by ourselves only. We are not working on 
the things that we need to achieve, we are not focusing on the things that are 
helping us to grow.
We get demotivated by our own expectations whenever we are upset or something 
bad happens in our life. We think that "This work is not for me, i am not build 
for success, success is not for me, i cannot achieve anything in my life." 
But the truth is, anyone can achieve anything, anyone can get success and be a 
billionaire. Only you have to focus on the right things that are meant for 
success and stay motivated towards it. 
The word "motivation" is derived from the word "motive". It means you should 
have a desire to achieve something, a goal to achieve something. We cannot stay 
motivated until and unless we have a goal towards it or have a strong desire in 
that thing. I am talking about desire not a wish. Desire and wish are two different 
things. Most of the people are tend to confuse in these two words. Desire means 
having a strong feeling of achieving it even if we are ready to do anything for 
it, even if we are ready to struggle a lot for it. And wish means having a 
feeling of wanting it, but we are not ready for the struggle, we are not ready 
for the process of wanting it, we just directly want the thing that we wish for. 
Similarly, we cannot stay motivated until and unless we have a strong and 
passionate desire about the thing. 
So here i am listing some points that can help you to stay motivated most of the time -
</p>
<p className="heading">1. Workout on your body: </p>
<img className="subHeadingImg" src="image\workout.png" alt="" />
<p className="singlePostDescNormal">
Working on your body is must. You might have heard about it that - 
"Doing physical excercises are very good our health." Excercises make our body 
fit and hard working. Similarly, we cannot stay motivated when our body is 
totally stiff and lack of energy. Nowadays, most of the time we sit on bed 
holding our smartphones for hours. There is no excercise, no workout, no 
movement of our body parts. This makes our body stiff and lazy and due to 
laziness and stiffness we are not in a mood to do anything productive or 
something that is good for our health. To stay motivated, physical excercises 
are very helpful, they make our body energetic and passionate about doing 
something with positivity. So first you have to start doing excercises for 
minimum half an hour. This can help in making you energetic and motivated 
towards your goal or towards achieving something.

<p className="heading">2. Learn something new everyday: </p>
<img className="subHeadingImg" src="image\learning.png" alt="" />
<p className="singlePostDescNormal">
The second way to stay motivated is to learn or gain something everyday. 
Whenever you feel like you are not having the energy to do this work or you are 
not motivated enough to do this, then remind yourself that your goal isn't about
 just finishing the work, your goal is about learning or gaining something new 
 and knowledgeable everyday. <br/>
We cannot work 24*7 . Everyone needs rest and relax time. In that relaxing 
time, you can learn something everyday to stay motivated. Wake up early in 
the morning if you are not getting time to learn something new. If you still 
can't manage to learn something new, take out Saturday and Sunday(weekends) 
for learning. Atleast give some hours in a week to yourself for gaining 
something new and knowledgeable. Read positive thoughts, read knowledgeable and 
positive books, be around positive people or people with positive mindsets....by
 doing this, your mind powers will be strong enough to handle difficult 
 situations and strong enough for staying motivated even if negativity is thrown
  at you. You can make better decisions in each and every aspect of your life. 
  You can be powerful enough to do your work with all your interest. </p>
  <p className="heading">3. Do a thing you love: </p>
<img className="subHeadingImg" src="image\thingyoulove.png" alt="" />
  <p className="singlePostDescNormal">
  It is necessary to do a thing or activity in which you are having interest to 
  stay happy and cheerful in life. Imagine, if you are having your job in which 
  you are not interested or you are having the work which is not designed for 
  you, you have to forcefully do this work/job because of some circumstances. 
  Whole week you are pissing off in a job that you don't like. Eventually you 
  will get frustrated and demotivated by yourself. You'll think that - you have 
  nothing left entertaining in your life, you can never do something that you 
  have interest in. But when you do an activity daily or once in a week that 
  you love, you will be automatically charged up, you will automatically gain 
  motivation by yourself, you will start loving your life and start loving your 
  job too and positive thoughts will automatically hit you like - "Everything 
  will be alright and better days are coming for me." If you are not getting 
  time daily to do anything that you love, you can do that on Sundays or in your 
  free time. But atleast do it once in a week. You know that you are going to do
   that irritating job or a job that seems uninteresting to you whole week, but 
   atleast one day you are doing something that you have really interest in, you
    are doing something that makes you really happy and joyful. You can take any
     activity that you love such as reading books, photography, singing, playing
      games, playing with pets or as simple as going for a hangout with friends.
       This can keep you motivated.

       <p className="heading">4. Increase your intellectual capacity: </p>
<img className="subHeadingImg" src="image\intellectual.png" alt="" />
       <p className="singlePostDescNormal">
       To stay motivated, it is important to be intellectual in every situation.
        Being intellectual means increasing your mental ability, utilising your 
        mind in a proper manner or involving ideas at a high level. Let us look 
        through an example. Imagine you are having the most expensive car such 
        as Lamborghini. You have to drive that and go to your work. And you have 
        tied a Buffaloe in front of your car... and now you are driving it for 
        going to work. The car which can run at the speed of 500, you are driving 
        it at the speed of 5 ! This is called lack of intellectual capacity. 
        (It was just a normal example so that anyone can understand). 
        Intellectual doesn't always means common sense or working with normal 
        ideas but it means that how much you are thinking innovatively about a 
        thing/work or anything. <br />
Increase your thinking ability, increase your creativity, increase your 
knowledge to stay motivated. You can do this by reading books that can increase 
your skills and abilities, by learning a skillful course online or you can do 
this by being around minded people and the people who are expert in life growth. 
Surround yourself with such things that can help you to grow, to motivate and 
to inspire. Listen to the positive music, read motivational quotes and articles. 
When you surround yourself with these people or things, you can be more positive,
 motivated and an inspiring person.
       </p>
       <p className="heading">5. Be extremely optimistic: </p>
<img className="subHeadingImg" src="image\optimistic.png" alt="" />
       <p className="singlePostDescNormal">
       Being optimistic means having a positive attitude or a positive response 
       in every situation. An optimistic person is the one who is always 
       confident and who thinks of favourable conditions in most of the aspects 
       in life. He/She (An optimistic person) is the one who handle everything 
       in a positive way rather than a negative way. Being an optimistic person 
       can help you in making better decisions in life, gives you reason for 
       living, promotes hapiness, self-respect and integrity. A research also 
       shows that being an optimistic helps in prolonging life i.e., you may 
       live 85+ . As this shows... being an optimistic can help you a lot in 
       motivating you. You can easily achieve anything, a positive person is the 
       one who can achieve anything and can make anyone positive around him/her. 
       For being an optimistic person, you need to be positive and confident 
       towards your future even if you are surrounded by failures. Success and 
       failure are both contradictory to each other. But they both can't resist 
       without each other...they are like a pair of socks. We cannot wear one 
       sock to wear shoes, we have to wear both of them to achieve comfort and 
       good look. Similarly, we cannot achieve success without failure. Failures 
       gives us more experiences and better outcomes in success. It makes us more 
       stronger and determined towards achieving something than before. Once you 
       will feel discouraged, upset or frustrated in failure but always remember 
       these feelings won't last longer. Everyday is a new day and a new beginning. 
       You have to be confident, determined and focussed towards achieving your 
       success to stay motivated. So.. be optimistic, confident and realistic in 
       each and every situation and think that the best possible thing will happen 
       even if it's not likely to.
